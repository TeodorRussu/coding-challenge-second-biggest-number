**The task:**
"Please create a new Java or Kotlin project using Maven or Gradle. Then design and implement a function which
accepts any structure able to iterate over integers and returns the 2nd biggest element on that structure. Note that
there might be millions of elements".

**More clarifications:**

_Question_: What is the expected behavior if the input has the maximum element duplicated:
for example, for the input: '{1, 2, 3, 9, 9}', do we expect the output 9 or 3?

_Answer_: 9
